# tinker-component-lib

An example react component library based on [Building a React Component Library](https://medium.com/@_alanbsmith/building-a-react-component-library-part-1-d8a1e248fe6c)

## Goals and concepts

Follows concepts introduced by Brad Frost's [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
Goal of this library is to create components that are easily extensible and re-usable.

Atoms -> Elements
* each element should be able to stand on its own

Molecules -> Components
* simple and distinct combinations of elements/atoms
